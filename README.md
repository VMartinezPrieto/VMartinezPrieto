### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm one of many Spanish living in Edinburgh, trying to get back into coding after learning a few basics back in 2010
### Working as a waiter right now, but aiming to not do it for too long
### My hobbies include having 3 to 5 coffees a day, watching anime and playing D&D (forever Bard)
### Feel free to add as many branches as you want, I'm here to learn!

### Victor
